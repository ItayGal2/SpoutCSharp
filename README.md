# SpoutCSharp
A C# Spout implemantation for MonoGame

This Code is using some custom constructors for MonoGame RenderTarget2D and Texture2D classes which i added, to help create and use the shared textures easily.
To see what addition i made on MonoGame check my post at Monogame forum:

http://community.monogame.net/t/shared-textures-on-dx/6770 

The underlying of MonoGame DirectX version is SharpDX and this code can be easily converted to use that.

The code is not documented but it is very simple and i hope that the method names are self explanatory.
